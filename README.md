### General description of the project
This project, made by Ignazio Emanuele Piccich√®, Mattia Castiello and Michela Di Simone, has the purpose to develop a Real-Time Collaboration Platform that not only supports shared document editing but is also resilient to network partitions, thereby ensuring a reliable user experience.

#### Project Objectives
- Allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously, leveraging the use of WebSockets.
- Mantaining data consistency even in the presence of network partitions, using the _Conflict-free Replicated Data Types_ (CRDTs) technique.
- Handle network partitions in a way that ensures all changes are correctly integrated once the partition is resolved.
- Effectively notify the presence of users, informing who is currently connected to the shared document.

#### Challenges
To verify the robustness of the platform, targeted experiments were conducted, including:
- Simulating network partitions to test the system's ability to reconcile changes.
- Analyzing the impact of different conflict resolution strategies on the system's consistency and latency.
